# MODLOG

What changed and what was tested. Newest entries at the top.
Format: [MODLOG-template.md](MODLOG-template.md).

## 2026-10-11 Read the modding guides, adopt their templates and working method

**Changed:** Cloned `ai-game-modding-guides` (commit `0c14be4`) and
`GameDecompLibrary` (commit `0e1357d`) into `reference/`, which is never
committed (added to `.gitignore`). Copied `MODLOG-template.md` and
`STATUS-handoff.md` to the project root (AGENTS.md refers to them).
Added `docs/provenance/README.md`, a "working method" section in
`docs/DESIGN.md`, new findings in `docs/RESEARCH.md` (versions, ScummVM,
GameDecompLibrary, EULA), and an attribution-template layout in `CREDITS.md`.
README now says it's an unofficial fan project and mentions AI use.
Reformatted this log to the template.
**Why:** You asked me to follow the guides. They recommend recording
provenance, splitting disassembly work across two sessions, and the
templates AGENTS.md expects.
**Tested how:** `git status --short -uall` to check only our own files show
up, and `git check-ignore` on `reference/`.
**Result:** Only project files are listed; `reference/`, `MASK/`, `target/`
and `kq8-artifacts/` are ignored. No code changed, so `vol-verify` was not
rerun.
**Still broken / not tested:** Nothing new to test. One mistake caught:
I first wrote an unverified claim in the provenance file (that all VOL
streams start with `00 04/05/06`). Corrected it to what was actually observed.
**Next:** Step 2 of the plan, a `.pbm` bitmap + `.ppl` palette dumped to PNG.

## 2026-10-11 Step 1: read VOL archives, prove the data loads

**Changed:** Whitelist `.gitignore`; Cargo workspace with `kq8-data`
(`VolArchive`, `GameDir`) and `kq8-cli` (`kq8 vol-verify`); `docs/DESIGN.md`,
`docs/RESEARCH.md`, `CREDITS.md`.
**Why:** The smallest proof that we can read the original data. Every other
format lives inside these archives.
**Tested how:** `cargo test` (3 unit tests on a hand-built archive), then
`cargo run --release -- vol-verify` on the GOG 1.03 install.
**Result:** 48 archives, 14,444 entries, 382,267,214 bytes unpacked, all
14,444 byte-identical to the installer's unpacked copies, 0 errors, 0 size
slack, ~8.5 s. `RESULT: PASS`.
**Still broken / not tested:** The reference copies were unpacked by
`kqmoevol`, not by `Mask.exe`, so this proves agreement with kqmoevol, not a
direct comparison with the original game. Not tested on Linux/macOS.
**Next:** Bitmaps and palettes.
