# Third-person and first-person camera

Study session A, 2026-10-11. Sources: game data files, the game's own
manual (`MASK/Manual.pdf`, "Controlling the Camera"), and `Mask.exe`
(studied, described here in our own words). Covers the gameplay camera that
follows Connor. Scripted cutscene cameras (`KQCamera::addCamLoc`,
`cutToCamLoc`, `flyToCamLoc`) and camera shake are only summarised.

## Purpose

Keep Connor in view while he moves, let the player swing, zoom and tilt the
camera, avoid putting the camera under the ground, and offer a first-person
view.

## Units

Game units (very likely millimetres; see `connor-movement.md`), radians.
"Per update" means per game update; the original runs at 15 updates per
second (`KQGame::FPSLimit 15` in `console.cs`).

## Controls

From `MASK/Connor.sae`, `MASK/Camera.sae` and the manual:

| Input | Action | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hold right mouse + move mouse left/right | `MoveCamera` | Swing the camera around Connor |
| Hold right mouse + move mouse forward/back | `MoveCamera` | Zoom in/out (normal mode) or tilt (fixed mode) |
| Shift (held) | `ModifyDn`/`ModifyUp` | While held, swap the two modes' meaning of forward/back mouse |
| Page Up / Page Down | `RotateX ±0.05` | Tilt up/down (normal mode) or zoom (fixed mode) |
| Home | `ResetX` | Put the tilt back to default |
| F11 | `CameraChangeMode` | Switch normal ↔ fixed-distance mode |
| F2 | `CameraFirstPerson` | Switch third ↔ first person |

The manual's own words: the camera "will attempt to keep Connor in the
middle of the screen"; "continuing to hold the right mouse button down
while Connor moves will maintain the camera in the same relative position";
tilt "will automatically reset itself as soon as Connor moves".

`Camera.sae` also binds letter keys (`a z s f e c o p k l j m`) to direct
camera moves and turns (`MoveX/Y/Z`, `RotateX/Y/Z`, `...2`). These shift
the camera itself by fixed steps and look like development helpers. Not
needed for normal play; keep them behind a debug switch.

## Rules

### What the camera looks at

1. The camera follows one object, normally Connor
   (`KQCamera::follow Connor`; `KQCamera::follow none` stops following,
   used around cutscenes).
2. It aims at a point **1,400 units above** the followed object's base
   (Connor is 1,600 tall, so roughly head height).
3. The view direction is from the camera to that point, so Connor stays in
   the middle of the screen.

### Distance (normal mode, the default)

1. The camera does **not** sit at a fixed spot behind Connor. It stays where
   it is until the distance to the aim point goes outside a range:
   - farther than the **maximum** → pulled in to 1 unit inside the maximum
     (so it trails behind Connor like on a leash);
   - closer than the **minimum** → pushed out to 1 unit beyond the minimum.
2. The range is set by scripts with `KQCamera::setRange <min> <max>`
   (min must be smaller than max, otherwise the command is refused):
   - walking: 1,000 – 2,500 (`GAME/Kq/walk.cs`)
   - running: 1,500 – 5,000 (`GAME/Kq/run.cs`)
   - before any script sets it: 1,500 – 5,000.
3. Distances are measured in 3D, from camera to aim point.

### Distance (fixed mode, F11)

1. The camera keeps the distance it had when the mode was switched on, at
   whatever angle Connor's movement leaves it.
2. That distance can be changed by zooming (Shift + right-drag, or Page
   Up/Down) and is kept between minimum + 1 and maximum − 1. Page Up/Down
   change it by 0.05 × 2,500 = 125 units per update while held.

### Height above the ground

1. The camera wants to be at least **1,400 units above the terrain under
   the camera**, and at least 1,400 units above the followed object's base.
   The higher of the two wins.
2. If the camera is within 100 units of that height it jumps straight to it;
   otherwise it moves **10% of the remaining gap per update** (smooth rise
   and fall).
3. The terrain height under the camera comes from the world's terrain (M1).

### Swinging and zooming with the mouse

1. While the right mouse button is held, sideways mouse movement swings the
   camera around the aim point (around the vertical axis). The swing angle is
   proportional to the mouse movement, with a factor of 3π/4 per unit of the
   game's mouse value; how mouse pixels map to that unit is open question 1.
2. Forward/back mouse movement in normal mode moves the camera along the
   line to the aim point (zoom) by 5,000 units per unit of mouse value,
   whatever the current distance. The result is still kept inside the
   min/max range. If a zoom would carry the camera past the aim point to
   the other side, it is instead placed at the minimum distance on its
   original side.
3. In fixed mode (or normal mode with Shift held) forward/back mouse
   movement tilts instead, by 0.1 × 7.5 × mouse movement.
4. The first update after pressing the button uses no movement (only the
   change since the previous update counts, and there is none yet).
5. Releasing the button clears the stored mouse movement.

### Tilt (pitch)

1. Default tilt is **0.2 rad** (about 11°). The original stores it as −0.2;
   from the manual it is a slight look down at Connor, but the sign
   convention is open question 2.
2. Page Up/Down tilt at 0.1 × 3 × 0.05 = **0.015 rad per update** while held
   (0.225 rad/s at 15 updates per second).
3. Tilt is limited to ±1.57 rad (straight up/down) in third person.
4. Home returns tilt to the default.
5. Tilt also returns to the default by itself when Connor moves: in normal
   (not fixed) mode, once he has moved more than 10 units horizontally
   (measured as |Δx| + |Δy|) while the tilt is not at default, it snaps back.
   This matches the manual ("it will automatically reset itself as soon as
   Connor moves").

### Swinging back behind Connor

1. When Connor turns so that the camera is no longer behind him, and the
   player is not using the mouse on the camera, the camera swings round
   towards his back by itself. It starts when the angle between "behind
   Connor" and the camera's direction exceeds about 0.25 rad, and moves a
   fraction of the remaining angle each update.
2. The exact states and rates (constants seen: 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 1/3, 0.21,
   10/3) were not fully decoded: open question 7.

### Obstacles

1. Every update, the game checks the straight line from the aim point to
   the camera against the world.
2. If something blocks it, the camera is brought in front of the obstacle
   (about 100 units short of the hit point) and may swing gradually round
   the target to find a clear view. The details of this swing were not fully
   worked out (open question 4).

### First person (F2)

1. The view is from Connor's eyes, facing where he faces.
2. Tilt is limited to between −0.54 rad and +1.57 rad (the first-person
   limits differ from third person).
3. Mouse forward/back tilts (factor 0.1 × 10 per unit of mouse value).
4. If the player has tilted and Connor then moves more than 10 units (and
   the mouse is not tilting), the tilt snaps back to the default.
5. The game also tips the view to follow the slope of the ground Connor
   stands on (amount scaled by 2/π of the slope angle, within the tilt
   limits). Details are open question 5.
6. Connor's first-person animations and arm models come from the
   `...FpAnimList` and `ConnerFpSkinList` entries in `GAME/Kq/Connor.kq`.

### Shake and cutscene cameras (summary only)

- `KQCamera::shake <seconds> <xMax> <xPeriod> <zMax> <zPeriod>` wobbles the
  camera with two sine waves for the given time (usage text in the game).
- `KQCamera::addCamLoc x y z [newlist]` builds a list of camera spots;
  `cutToCamLoc x y z [roll]` jumps to one and aims at the given point;
  `flyToCamLoc x y z [seconds endRoll]` flies there over time. Scripts use
  these in cutscenes. To be studied before M3/M4.

## Data used

- `MASK/Connor.sae`, `MASK/Camera.sae`: bindings.
- `GAME/Kq/walk.cs`, `run.cs`: `KQCamera::setRange` per movement mode.
- World scripts (`daventry/kq/*.cs` and others): `KQCamera::follow`,
  cutscene commands.
- Terrain height (from M1 terrain work).

## Edge cases

- `setRange` with min ≥ max: refused, range unchanged (the game prints an
  error message).
- Switching walk → run widens the range; the camera does not jump, it just
  has more room before it gets pulled or pushed.
- Following `none`: camera stays where it is.

## Do not reproduce

- **Per-update rates.** The height smoothing (10% per update), tilt speed
  (0.015 rad per update) and fixed-mode zoom (125 units per update) depend on
  frame rate in the original. Implement them per second so they match the
  original at 15 updates per second:
  - height: close `1 − 0.9^(15 × elapsed seconds)` of the remaining gap;
  - tilt: 0.225 rad/s; fixed-mode zoom: 1,875 units/s.

## How to check

- Log camera distance to Connor while walking in a straight line: it
  should settle at just under 2,500 (walk) or 5,000 (run).
- Log camera height above terrain on a hill: never below 1,400 for long;
  rises smoothly.
- Hold Page Up for 1 s: tilt changes by about 0.225 rad.
- Right-drag sideways: camera circles Connor at constant distance.
- In the original game, compare screenshots of the same spot with the same
  inputs (you can do this by eye; we only compare numbers we log).

## Open questions

1. How mouse movement (pixels) becomes the game's mouse value. Needed for
   swing/zoom speed.
2. Sign convention of tilt (is the stored −0.2 "look down"?).
3. (Answered: tilt resets after Connor moves more than 10 units, in both
   views; see Tilt rule 5.)
4. The obstacle swing: how far and how fast the camera swings round, and
   when it gives up.
5. First-person slope tilt details and the eye height.
6. Whether the camera updates at the same rate as Connor (assumed yes).
7. The automatic swing behind Connor: when exactly it starts and stops, and
   how fast it turns.
