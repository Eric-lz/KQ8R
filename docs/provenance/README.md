# Provenance

Where each piece of knowledge in this project came from. Modelled on IW4L's
`docs/provenance/`. Add an entry whenever code is written from a new source.

Source types:

- **Observed**: worked out by reading the player's own game data files.
- **Documented (permissive)**: from a third-party source under a licence
  that allows reuse (MIT, Apache, ...).
- **Documented (GPL)**: from a GPL project. Used only for *facts about file
  layouts*, never code or wording, so our code is not a derivative of it.
- **Disassembly**: from studying `Mask.exe`. Not used yet. See the working
  method in `docs/DESIGN.md` before using this source.

## VOL archives — `crates/kq8-data/src/vol.rs`

| Fact | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `RESLIST\0` signature, 20-byte name, u32 next-entry offset, PKWARE DCL data | Documented (permissive): `kqmoevol.c` by Nico Bendlin, MIT, <https://svn.nicode.net/kqmoevol/> (read 2026-10-11, trunk) |
| Data is PKWARE DCL | Observed: `Mask.exe` contains the "PKWARE Inc." copyright string; the first entry of `Daventry/kq.vol` starts `00 04` (DCL binary mode, 2 KB window); every entry decompressed without error |
| Name may contain a space (`Ogre01 .BMP`) | Documented (permissive): kqmoevol's name check special-cases it. Observed: present once in `Barren/8bit.vol` |
| Last entry's next offset equals archive size; no padding between entries | Observed: `kq8 vol-verify` reports 0 size slack across all 48 archives |

Our code was written from scratch from these facts; no lines were copied.
Decompression is done by the `explode` crate (MIT), not by our code.

## Bitmaps and palettes — `crates/kq8-data/src/{chunks,bitmap,palette}.rs`

"GPL notes" = `libkq8fpc/doc/kq8pbmp.txt` and `kq8ppal.txt` (Nico Bendlin,
GPL-3.0 repository, r34). Facts only; code and wording are our own.

| Fact | Source | Checked how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chunk = 4-byte tag, u32 size, payload | GPL notes | Observed: all 6,495 bitmaps and 44 `.ppl` split cleanly to end of file (`kq8 bitmap-verify`) |
| `PBMP` / `PPAL` size field is meaningless; skip the 8-byte marker | GPL notes | Observed: `daventry.pbm` PBMP size is 0x4B020, file is 0x4B038 bytes |
| `head` = u32 (24-bit chunk count, 8-bit version), width, height, bits, flags | GPL notes | Observed: `daventry.pbm` head gives 640×480×8 and the data chunk is exactly 307,200 bytes |
| Head chunk count can be too high for bitmaps | GPL notes | Observed: 74 bitmaps say 3, have 2 |
| Palette head count is 1–2 lower than the real chunk count | Observed (new) | 34 palettes say 3/have 4, 8 say 4/have 5, 2 say 4/have 6. What the engine does with this is unknown |
| Flag bits: 1 transparent, 2 dither, 4 translucent, 8 owns memory | GPL notes | Observed: values seen are only 0x8 and 0x9. Meaning of bits not verified |
| Unmipmapped rows padded to 4 bytes, top row first; 24-bit is blue-green-red | GPL notes | Observed: no unmipmapped 24-bit chunked files exist, so the 24-bit part is untested on real data |
| Mipmapped data: levels back to back, each ¼ of the previous, count in `DETL` (1..9), data padded to 4 | GPL notes | Observed: 128×64 file holds 10,924 bytes = 7 levels + 2 padding; all 1,173 mipmapped files parse; counts seen 3,5,6,7,8,9 |
| Palette `data` = 256 × (red, green, blue, flags) | GPL notes | Observed: entries 1–8 of `Menus.ppl` are the Windows system colours in that order |
| Engine forces first and last 8 colours to the Windows system colours | GPL notes | **Not verified** against `Mask.exe`. Changes 1 entry in `Menus.ppl`/`daventry.ppl` and 15 in the loading palettes; `daventry.pbm` uses none of those colours, so it does not affect its output |
| `.dib` and most archive `.bmp` are plain Windows BMP | Observed | 3,382 `.bmp` + 31 `.dib` start with `BM` and parse as uncompressed BMP; 8 of them are 24-bit |
| `.pal` is a Windows RIFF palette, 237 or 256 colours | Observed | 6 files. Which colours the engine uses from a 237-entry one is unknown |
| `GAME/8Gui/daventry.pbm` uses the loading palette (`GAME/8Gui/l*.ppl`) | Observed (measurement), confirmed by eye by the user 2026-10-11 | Neighbour colour change with every palette in the game: 18.4 with all 16 `GAME/8Gui/l*.ppl` (identical colour tables), 44.5 with `daventry.ppl`, 107.5 with `Menus.ppl`. The user confirmed `daventry.ppl` looks wrong (dark, speckled). Which `l*.ppl` file the engine loads is unknown, but all 16 have the same colours |

## Models and material lists — `crates/kq8-data/src/{pers,material,shape}.rs`

No behaviour note was used (none exists for this topic). "GPL notes" =
`libkq8fpc/doc/kq8kqs.txt`, `kq8dml.txt`, `kq8pers.txt` (Nico Bendlin,
GPL-3.0 repository, downloaded 2026-10-11, directory revision 22). Facts
about file layouts only; code and wording are our own. "Checked" numbers
come from `kq8 shape-verify` on the GOG 1.03 install
(`kq8-artifacts/logs/shape-verify.log`).

| Fact | Source | Checked how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PERS block: tag, 31-bit size + 1 alignment bit, i16 class name length, name padded to even, then i32 version | GPL notes | Observed: all 4,573 `KQ8::Shape` files and 25 `.dml` files parse with 0 unread bytes and 0 bytes after the block |
| `KQ8::Shape` field order and per-version differences (v1–v4: light nodes from v2, attenuation start v3, intensity v4; v1 sequences have 2 junk bytes) | GPL notes | Observed: versions seen v1 29, v2 55, v3 3,921, v4 568; all parse exactly to the end |
| `TS::CelAnimMesh` layout, v2 mesh-wide scale/origin vs v3 per-frame scale/origin | GPL notes | Observed: 56 v2 and 23,097 v3 meshes parse exactly; no mesh had 0 frames |
| Vertex = 3 bytes (0..254) × scale + origin, plus 1 byte normal index | GPL notes | Observed: frame vertex 0 / 1 equal the min / max of the remaining vertices in all 471,186 frames |
| Face vertex indices are relative to the frame's first vertex | GPL notes | Observed: indices range 2..1153, never 0 or 1 (the bounding-box slots), never past the frame |
| Texture coordinates for a node start at `texture_frame × texture vertices per frame` | Our reading of the GPL notes | Observed: 0 out-of-range indices in the rest pose of every model. All coordinates lie in 0..1 |
| Parts are drawn with their mesh node transform only; the sequence's frame transform is **not** used for drawing (it is the step the whole object makes during an animation) | Behaviour note `docs/behaviour/models-and-textures.md`, Q1 (b) (session A, from data, high confidence) | Replaces our earlier choice "node, then sequence". Observed: `kq8 shape-verify` rest-pose numbers for all 4,573 models are identical before and after the change (frame 0 has a zero step, as the note says). Using the frame transform for moving objects is for M2/M3 |
| Transform = point as a row vector times the 3×3 matrix, plus translation | **Measured**, then confirmed by behaviour note `models-and-textures.md` Q1 (a) | 412,731 of 578,976 transforms rotate, so it matters. In 2,739 multi-part models, vertices of one part touching another part: 4,891 this way vs 2,761 transposed; clear wins 245 vs 7, 2,487 undecided. By eye: the chest's lid sits closed on the box (with the transposed matrix the measurement says its parts would not meet). Strong evidence, not proof (question Q1) |
| The game's Z axis is up | **Measured** (new) | Tallest axis: z in 2,950 models, y 1,014, x 590. Lowest point at z ≈ 0 in 3,177 models (y 90, x 29) |
| The rest pose is the first sequence of the first loop | Our choice | Observed: 4,571 models have 1 loop, 2 have 2 |
| Material: **u32** flags (the GPL note says u8), f32 alpha, i32 palette, 4 colour bytes, name of 16 (v1) or 32 (v2) bytes | GPL notes, corrected by observation | Observed: `davennew.dml` = 38-byte header + 255 × 32 bytes = 8,198 bytes exactly; flag values like 0x10103 need more than 8 bits |
| Material kind in bits 0..3 (3 = texture, 2 = colour, 0 = none), shading in bits 8..11 | GPL notes | Observed: 12,997 texture, 1 colour, 223 none. Flags seen: 0x403 11,221, 0x103 1,538, 0x10103 142, 0x203 75, 0x1403 20, 0xF000 31, 0x0 192. Meaning of 0x1000 and 0x10000 unknown |
| Texture names refer to files in a world's archives; models in `GAME/Common` have no textures next to them | Observed | 7,355 texture references found in the same world, 5,613 only in another world (mostly `GAME/Common` models), 0 in `GAME/`, 29 names missing everywhere (listed in the log) |
| Textures use the world palette (`resource/daventry.ppl` for Daventry) | Measured | Neighbour colour change on `wood2`, `Hay`, `g2g1str`: 39.3 / 77.1 / 20.4 with `daventry.ppl` and `8bit/daventry.pal` (identical), 46.3 / 77.1 / 35.9 with `daventr1.pal` (question Q3) |
| `TS::Shape` v2 in 4 Daventry tomb files | GPL notes (says unused leftovers) | Counted and skipped, not parsed |
| Normals: we compute them from the triangles | **Deliberate difference** | The game stores a normal index per vertex into a 256-entry table. The table is in the GPL notes; we do not copy it. We do not need it while models are drawn without lighting |

## Model viewer — `crates/kq8-viewer/src/{load,main}.rs`

| Fact or choice | Source | Checked how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game (x, y, z) → Bevy (x, z, −y), a rotation not a mirror | Our choice, from the measured "Z is up" | Confirmed by eye by the user 2026-10-11: `smlchest.KQS` (lid closed on the box, texture correct) and `alcmsign.KQS` look right. Mirroring not ruled out: the user saw nothing wrong, but we did not confirm that either model has readable lettering. Handedness is still question Q2 |
| Divide game units by 100 for display | Our choice | Display only; says nothing about the game's units |
| Model at rest = first sequence of first loop | Our choice | `alcmsign.KQS` (alchemist's sign): its loop is 31 sequences over 2.0 s. The sign tilts 10° in sequence 0, 0° in sequence 6, 10° in 15, 0° in 23, i.e. it swings. So the first sequence is not always a resting pose; the user saw the sign tilted, as expected from this |
| Textures use the world palette `<World>.ppl`; Windows-BMP textures use their own colour table | Measured | Viewer log: in `ITEMS22`, `HAY`, `alchy`, `TORCHY` (Daventry) every used colour of the own table equals `DAVENTRY.PPL`, so both give the same picture |
| Textures not in the current world are taken from another world | Our choice (question Q4) | Logged per texture when it happens |
| Front faces are the clockwise ones; back faces hidden; no mirror | Behaviour note `models-and-textures.md`, Q2 (session A: 98.9% of 1.49M triangles clockwise seen from the front; back-face removal on in the Glide renderer) | Viewer reverses each triangle's corners (Bevy's front is counter-clockwise) and keeps Bevy's back-face hiding. Observed: 30 of 32 chest triangles then face away from its centre (old order would give 2 of 32). Checked by eye by the user 2026-10-11: `smlchest.KQS` and `alcmsign.KQS` look right from all sides |
| No lighting, linear filtering, texture repeats | Our choice while lighting is not studied | — |

## Terrain — `crates/kq8-data/src/{kq_text,terrain}.rs`

Behaviour note = `docs/behaviour/terrain.md` (session A, answers Q6/Q7).
"Checked" numbers come from `kq8 terrain-verify`
(`kq8-artifacts/logs/terrain-verify.log`).

| Fact | Source | Checked how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.kq` files are `[section]` + `key=value` lines, `;` comments, keys in mixed case | Observed | All 17 terrain files parse; object files read for the height check |
| Terrain files live loose in `data/<World>/KQ/Terrain/` (not in `kq.vol`); images, `.dml` and light maps are in `resource.vol` | Observed | `terrain-verify` finds every named file there (except below) |
| Missing setting defaults (groundScale 12, heightBMPScale 60, `terrain.dml`, `terrm.dib`, `terrh.dib`) | Behaviour note | No terrain file leaves these out, so not exercised |
| Square = 2^groundScale units; grid corner at (0, 0); pixel column = x, bottom image row = y 0; height = value × heightBMPScale | Behaviour note | Observed: objects exactly on our ground (within 0.5 units): Daventry 11, Barren 11, Ice World 11, Dead City 7, Snow exit 2. Daventry's 11 span heights 6,630–30,600. Daventry's scale is exactly 255 per grey step (the note's 256.2 was objects standing a little above the ground; many stand exactly +5 or +25) |
| Two flat triangles per square; diagonal (0,0)–(1,1) when i + j is even, (1,0)–(0,1) when odd | Behaviour note | Unit tests for both diagonals. Observed: `St_gdad` stands between grid points and matches to 0.1 units |
| Height image has a plain grey colour table | Behaviour note | Observed: true for every terrain image |
| Direction table: u32 count, then per record u32 index, 16-byte name, u32 (always 0), u32 0..7 | Observed | Exact file sizes; names match the material list in the same order for every world (e.g. 255/255 Daventry, 164/164 Swamp, 170/170 Dead City). Meaning of the 0..7 value open (Q8) |
| Material image is one value per square; no value past the list | Observed | 128×128 in every world; 0 squares out of range. Meaning not confirmed (Q8): Daventry's most used value is 159 = `stone1.bmp` on 15,224 of 16,384 squares |
| `terrain2.kq` in temple1–4 names `ice.dml`, which those worlds do not have | Observed | Reported as a note; those grids are flat (all heights 0) |
| No holes | Our choice until the note answers it (terrain.md open question 3) | — |

## Formats read but not yet implemented

`libkq8fpc/doc/*.txt`: notes on `.msg`, `.kqs`, `.pba`, `.pft` and others
were read for an overview. Each fact taken from them will be listed here
when implemented.
